# colourtester
Captures an image and analyses it for the most dominant colour.

Currently works on macOS only and uses the built-in webcam (if on Macbook).

Exercise in computer vision using OpenCV and some creative engineering to prolong webcam shutter speed!


Installation:

1. Install Python3, numpy, opencv as dependencies.
2. Run the file in terminal "python3 colourtest.py".
